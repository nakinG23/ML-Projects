🤖 ML-Projects

A collection of my hands-on projects and implementations in Machine Learning.

📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio of all the machine learning projects I have worked on. Each project is a step in my journey toward mastering ML concepts and applying them to real-world problems. The projects cover a range of topics including Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, and Predictive Modeling. (some may be planned and not in progress right now)

🛠️ Projects Included

🔹 1. SmartFarm RL Agent (Reinforcement Learning)

Goal: Trains an autonomous robot to navigate a smart farm, clear weeds, avoid obstacles, and optimize battery usage.
Tech Stack: OpenAI Gym, SARSA, Matplotlib, Pygame (for visualization)
📂 RL-robot-on-farm

🔹 2. Predicting the death of GOT characters (Neural Networks)

Goal: Trains a model using a multilayer perceptron to predict the death of GOT characters with ~ 76% accuracy
Tech Stack: Keras, scikit-learn, pandas
📂 NN-character-predictions 

🔍 How to Run a Project
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:nakinG23/ML-Projects.git <br>
cd ML-Projects


	2.	Navigate to the project folder:

cd RL-robot-on-farm


	3.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:

jupyter notebook

or

python main.py



📌 Future Plans

🔹 Experiment with Deep Q-Learning (DQN) for reinforcement learning.
🔹 Implement transfer learning in Computer Vision projects.
🔹 Explore LLM fine-tuning for NLP applications.
